# Release process

## Versioning

Semantic versioning

major.minor[.patch]

Use patch for bugfixes

## Release candidates

major.minor-rcN

Use a release candidate before a major or minor release.

Single commit releases and patch releases don't need a release candidate.

## Steps

1. Bump version in kmax/about.py (perhaps this should be automated from [or to] git somehow?)
2. Add a new tag for the version in git, prefixed with a "v", e.g., v4.3.1, annotated with a description of the new verseion.
3. Make a release on github for major, minor, and patch version changes, using the same description from above for the release.
4. Publish to pypi (see scripts/pypi.sh)
