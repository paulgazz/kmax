The Kconfig parser in this directory has been copied from the
linux-4.12.8/scripts/kconfig directory.  `zconf.hash.c_shipped` has
been copied to `zconf.hash.c`.  The following minor changes have been
made:

1. In `expr.c`, the `static` keyword has been removed from
   `expr_compare_type` so it can be used by `check_dep.c`.

2. In `expr.h`, `struct symbol` is given two more fields:

        bool searched;
        bool depends;
3. In `expr.h`, `struct property` is given an extra field in order to
       save a select's original dependency `if` dependency, if any.

        struct expr *original_expr;

    This is used in conjunction with a change in `menu.c`'s
    `menu_add_prop` that saves the original visible expression after
    parsing the select line.
    
    Insert the following into the function `menu_add_prop`:
    
          if (P_SELECT == type) {
            // hang on to the original for kmax
            prop->original_expr = prop->visible.expr;
          }
          
    Right after 
    
        struct property *prop = prop_alloc(type, current_entry->sym);

        prop->menu = current_entry;
        prop->expr = expr;
        prop->visible.expr = dep;
        //insert it here

    The reason this is done is to avoid clause blowup in dimacs due to
    a config's entire dependencies between conjoined with select's
    `if` dependencies.  Our Boolean formulae already account for
    dependencies and don't need them on the select.

4. Add an undeclared symbol type so that we can distinguish between
   configs that haven't been declared and default values on unknown
   type.

        // expr.h
        enum symbol_type {
          S_UNKNOWN, S_BOOLEAN, S_TRISTATE, S_INT, S_HEX, S_STRING, S_UNDECLARED
        };
